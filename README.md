# Covid-in-Canada

A Covid19 case and vaccine tracker for Canada and its provinces powered by [opencovid.ca](https://opencovid.ca/api/) and build in React.

### [Check it out](http://covidincanada.kyleclarkson.ca/)

For Canada as a whole or one of its provinces, the total number of cases, recoveries, and deaths so far are shown, along with the most recent daily figures. The number of vaccines distributed and administered are also displayed.

The trend of new cases and active cases are shown using a 7-day average for each statisitc. An average of the last seven days is used due to how some provinces report numbers (e.g. British Columbia groups weekend reports into Monday's report) and to smooth the trend.

This is my first React app as I learn the framework. Any feedback would be appreciated (:
