# Covid-in-Canada

*No longer active* - this was one of my Covid projects. Thankfully, it is no longer needed and as such I've brought down the site.

A Covid19 case and vaccine tracker for Canada and its provinces powered by [opencovid.ca](https://opencovid.ca/api/) and built in React. 

For Canada as a whole or one of its provinces, the total number of cases, recoveries, and deaths so far are shown, along with the most recent daily figures. The number of vaccines distributed and administered are also displayed.

The trend of new cases and active cases are shown using a 7-day average for each statisitic. An average of the last seven days is used due to how some provinces report numbers (e.g. grouping weekend cases into Monday's cases) and to smooth the data to better see the overall trend.

This is my first React app as I learn the framework! Any feedback would be appreciated.
